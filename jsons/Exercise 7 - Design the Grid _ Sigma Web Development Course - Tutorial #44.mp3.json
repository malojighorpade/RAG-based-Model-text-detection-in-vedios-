{"text": " Today's exercise will test your CSS Grid skills. I will give you an exercise in which you have to apply your CSS Grid skills and make a layout. If you are going to solve this question, then write Challenge Accepted in the comment section below. This will let me know that you are going to solve this question. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Music I have come to the computer screen. The exercise number 7 is going to be the part below the website of UltraEdit. I will create a folder named video44. I will click on the shift button and open it in VS Code. I will put a boilerplate template here. Oops, what did I do? Index.html I will put a boilerplate template here. I will comment this website and write Design the body of this website. I will open this and show you. The website of UltraEdit that we made, which we made a new one in the last exercise. Now you have to use the CSS Grid to make this. I want to tell you the catch here. The catch is that you have to download the downloaded file first. If you are in Windows like me, then you have to click on Download 32-bit. As soon as you click on Download 32-bit, UltraEdit will be downloaded. And as soon as it is downloaded, I will place it in my folder. I have cut it from my download and brought it here. The name of the file is ue-english. I want to tell you that if I write here ahref=\"ue-english.exe\", and write here Download UltraEdit, Download UE, and if I show you the website, then you will see that as soon as I click on Download UE, it will be downloaded. And this time the download will come from here. So on your server, that is, your computer, what I am saying is that when you run your local website, then your server is your local computer. So in your local computer, there should be a file named ue-english.exe. And you will serve it from here. That means the links you are going to use, these links should come from here. That is, as soon as this link is clicked, then it will be downloaded. So you have to use this link everywhere. You can use the same link for the sake of convenience. And you have to design it from CSS Grid. So you will design it from CSS Grid. And on your big screen, your desktop, three columns should be visible. And you should see one column in your phone. So if I see here how UltraEdit does this thing, then I guess if you come here in the phone, then one column is visible. And if you do it this way, then three columns are visible. So you guys have to simply design this much portion from CSS Grid. We had designed the navbar in our last video. In the last exercise, you can copy it from there. Simply copy it, pick up the navbar and bring it here. If you design this portion too, then you will like it a lot. But I don't keep this portion as an exercise part. You can start directly from here. That is, you can delete this portion completely. And by the way, I'll tell you one thing. If you inspect here, and let's say this one, our portion of this website, which is this, see it's highlighted above, I will press delete here by selecting it. So it will be deleted here. So if I just show you, so now see here, I will reload it and show you again. This portion in which the download is UltraEdit, this is the portion. This portion. This is the portion. If I select this, click on it, and press delete, then it will fly away. So you can make it in this format. And all these links, even if the languages are different, but still you can use the same link. And you use different links, download different versions and put all the links. So that's a special shoutout to you. But again, I want to teach you CSS Grid here. And that's why I want you to download it once and put the same links. You can do that. But one thing is that you should have this server from your local computer. You have to take care of this a little bit here. So all of you will get a shoutout, whoever solves this, I will give a shoutout to everyone. Do write Challenge Accepted by liking the video. I know very few people like the video. But if you do, I feel very good from my heart. So if you want to do it, you can hit the like button. I will tell you a lot more in the coming videos. I had a lot of fun in this exercise. I also analyzed the solution for many of you. I thought your approach was quite right. Because you did many things in this way that I was also amazed that yes, you are understanding that where to use the link, you have to use the link in the like. So one thing I understand here that the way we do coding, the way we do work, our own common sense also builds. We also explore from our own. Maybe you have explored something from yourself that I don't know. And when you use it, I also learn. We are all students. We learn in life. So for now, I will wait for your solution of this exercise. If you have not accessed the Sigma web development playlist, then do access it. Either click here to bookmark it or click here to save it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thank you for watching it. Thank you for watching it.", "chunks": [{"title": "Exercise 7 - Design the Grid _ Sigma Web Development Course - Tutorial #44", "start": 0.0, "end": 4.0, "text": " Today's exercise will test your CSS Grid skills."}, {"title": "Exercise 7 -
