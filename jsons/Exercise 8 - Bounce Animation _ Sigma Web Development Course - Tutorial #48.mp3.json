{"text": " We have learnt transition and animation very well. Now it's time to check your transition and animation skills. I will give you a question that you have to solve. Do like the video and write Sigma patch in the comment section. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, the exercise I want to give you is on transition and animation. So I am going to make a folder named video 48. And after making this folder, I am going to open it in VS Code. Here I will make a file in the name of index.html and put a comment. And what I will do is I will give you a question in the comment. And because this is going to be done with transition and animation, we will use transition and animation. That was very easy to predict. So now comes the problem that you have to solve. You have been given this cube and you have been given a background here. What you have to do is bounce this cube here like a ball. And I make it a ball by giving it a border radius. So I will give it a border radius to make a ball. So let's do it. So I will come here and inspect here. I have put some CSS on my box. I will give it a border radius. Okay. Border radius. And here I will give it something like this such that it becomes a ball. It became a ball after 58 pixels. It became a ball after 69 pixels. So I will make it 70 pixels. Its border radius. Let's go. And after doing this, this box has become a ball. Okay. And I will put a semicolon here. And you see, it has become a ball. What you have to do is make this ball here in such a way that it bounces like a real ball. This is a physics simulation. And many of you will find it difficult. I will give you some hints in this. Because I know that it can be a little difficult for you. Now you can do this question either by transition or animation. I have no problem with that. It will be your choice. You want to do it by transition or animation. But I would like to give you a hint if you find it difficult. The first hint I want to give you is that you have to make a separate animation in X and separate animation in Y. At least I will solve it in this way. Make two separate animations. If you want to make any ball bounce, then the trajectory in the Y axis is like this. Its speed decreases. So think about such animation that its speed decreases. First make the animation of Y. Then make the animation of X. And how will the animation of X be? It will be linear. Because your speed in X does not decrease. And if you don't understand how to do it, then you try it. See, what you have to do in the X axis is to bring it from here to here. Such that when it is coming from here to here, then its speed decreases and becomes zero. And you have to repeat that animation backwards. How to do that, I told you in the animation video. And both the animations have to be pasted together. That's it. One linear animation and one animation you have to decide. And if you want to do it by transition, then you can do it by transition. So it will be your choice. I will not tell you anything. And you get it in the solution. Yes, I know it is a little advanced exercise. But I want all of you to attempt it. At least try it. And if you don't understand, then it's okay. Come to the solution. Listen to me. There is no problem. If you don't understand, then there is no tension. Don't think yourself useless. Don't think that if you don't understand, then you are useless. Many people think that exercise means that if you are not able to do it, then you don't understand. No. Actually, I will tell you how to do complex animations with exercise. But no, first I will tell you how to do it. If you like simple animations, then your confidence will go up. After doing this course, I want to make you a very successful web developer. You will not get stuck anywhere. If you don't do this kind of work, then you will not be able to do this in the course. I have to do this. And let's meet in the video of its solution. It is going to be very interesting. If you have not accessed this playlist, then you have to access it. Click here to bookmark. And the code has been uploaded in the GitHub. And I will see you next time.", "chunks": [{"title": "Exercise 8 - Bounce Animation _ Sigma Web Development Course - Tutorial #48", "start": 0.0, "end": 3.0, "text": " We have learnt transition and animation very well."}, {"title": "Exercise 8 -
