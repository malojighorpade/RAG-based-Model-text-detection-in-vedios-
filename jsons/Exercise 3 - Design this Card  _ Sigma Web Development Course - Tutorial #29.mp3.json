{"text": " As we move forward in this course, I will keep increasing the level. I told you that in exercise 3, we are going to do something that will be used in actual. That means you will see this kind of thing while building yourself. When you build websites for actual clients. If you have decided that you are going to solve this question, then write Challenge Accepted in the comment section below. I am very excited as usual. Let's see how much strength is there in this exercise. Let's roll the intro. You guys mark the topic of today's video. Because today we are going to start something very interesting. We will start actual development. I will show you a card PNG here. And you have to make this card. This is today's exercise. I am not going to write much here. But let's do it. It is also necessary to do a little formality. Now see what I will do here. I want to open this folder in VS Code. So I will open it by right-clicking on the shift key. And here you will see an index.html. I will put it here. And I will put a comment for you by putting a boilerplate. I will put a comment here. Card.png is a file which contains a card image. Write HTML and CSS code to design this card. Okay, understood? Everyone write in the comment that it is okay, understood. Okay, everyone has to write in the comment. And Challenge Accepted has to be written. And here you have to make a card like Card.png. Now if you have accepted the challenge. Will it be done or not? If you have confidence, tell me in the comment section below. See, you can use any image instead of this image. Okay, and I want exactly this card without compromise. This card image is an image. You have to write its code. And here you can also put something else. You put your text. There is no need to put any lorem here. Then here read more. Okay, now exactly I have not told you What is its color code? What is its length? What is its height? So make this card approximately. Okay, the image should not be bad. I am telling you in advance. It should not be that the aspect ratio of the image is bad. That will not be accepted. I will disqualify you. Okay, so if you do not want to be disqualified. Then make it well. If you do it well, you will get a shoutout. Now see here Lagodi Bryce is written. How will you bring this nature and this lake capsule? Now if you do it, you have written Challenge Accepted. So start doing it and post your solution too. Now I will tell you that when you post the solution. So use this hashtag. Hashtag HTML Today's hashtag is hashtag HTML. Post your solution using hashtag HTML. So that I can search with this hashtag. And I will know that you have posted the solution of this problem. Now let's do a little discussion. For those people who have lost their courage after seeing. How will this be done? I tell you, you stay with me. It is better to listen to me than not to do this exercise. But if you have accepted the challenge. Then start doing it without listening. If possible, then you can listen to me after posting this solution. See here you see that I have made a div. But assume that I will give the border radius in it. See how much border radius you have to give. You can give a set height to that div. I will tell you what is the meaning of this. Okay, I made this card. After this, I will put an image inside this div. And I will do the same for its border radius. I will give a heading so that it can make a little distance. After this, I will give the URL of this image. And please use a public URL. Use an image that is on the net. And by putting this image here. I will give only the width or height of the image. Because if I give only that much. It will be right, it will come inside it. After this, this div is over here. I will put an image inside a div. I will start another div. In which I will make these capsules of nature and lake. I will make this with the help of span. So that it stays in line. After this, I will put an h1 here. I will put a heading or h2 here. Because I will assume that on whichever page this card is going to go. The main heading will be h1. And this will be h2 heading. And here I will use a paragraph tag. Then I will put another div. In which I will put a button. In that div, I will center the text line. So that it is centered. And in the coming videos, you will get the solution of this. And I will also give a shoutout to the heroes. Who must have solved this problem. So if you have not yet accessed. The Sigma web development playlist. Then you can click here. Click here and save it. Now I want to tell you one thing. That it is decided that. The sigma course is a very good free course. For you. A lot of people are praising it. You have given a lot of love. But there are some people in the industry. Who are not happy with the free of the sigma course. I have told you before. And I will tell you now. That I am not against any kind of paid course. But sigma is a very dangerous. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Web development. In general, it is a complete course. No one can deny this. This is a very universal fact. And a lot of people feel bad. That I bought a paid course. Now I am getting such a good course for free. So cut your losses and do it. And a lot of people are talking about me. And contacting me. And indirectly targeting me. That this is like this. And the things I am doing. And the things I don't even want to discuss. That this is useless. Videos and what is useful. And what is useless. The world knows. And there is no need to justify it. There is no need to justify it. With this, access the playlist. Focus more on your learning. That's all for now in this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time.
