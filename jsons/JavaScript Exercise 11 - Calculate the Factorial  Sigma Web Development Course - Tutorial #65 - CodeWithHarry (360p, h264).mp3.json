{"text": " In Mathematics, factorial means that multiplication of all small numbers with 1 until 1 comes. That means if I talk about 5's factorial, then 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1. If I talk about 6, then 6 into 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1. I have to show you this type of factorial calculation. In this exercise, I am going to give you a question to calculate factorial. If you accept this challenge, then like this video first. And then write Challenge Accepted in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. \ud83c\udfb5 Intro Music \ud83c\udfb5 Today's question is very simple. So I will quickly make a folder named video65. I will make a folder named video65. And I will make a folder named video65 and open it in VS Code. I will put index.html here. After putting index.html, I will give you a question here. And that question is very simple. Write a program to calculate factorial of a number. Okay, so you have to find the factorial of that number using reduce and using for loops. Okay, so what you have to do here is to find the factorial of any number using reduce and using for loops. How will you find it? Suppose I gave you 6. So how will you find the factorial of 6? The factorial of 6 will be... By the way, if you don't know what factorial is, let me tell you. The factorial of 6 will be equal to 6 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 1. This will be our factorial of 6. So one thing you can do is that you can make an array of 1 to 6 or 6 to 1 and you can put a multiplication reduce on it. So the value will be factorial. Another way is that you can put a for loop and by putting a for loop you can find out what is the multiple of it. So you make a variable by the name of a product and in a for loop you will keep on decrementing the values or incrementing them. You can see how to do that. You will find the value of final factorial by two methods. One by reduce and one by for loop. So ball is in your court. So write challenge accepted in the comment section. If you haven't written it yet. And you need a solution too. That is more important than challenge accepted. If you write challenge accepted then I can know that you are pumped up and you are going to do it. And when you post the actual solution then the thing will come. So that's why you write challenge accepted and solve it. I need the solution of everything. If you are not accessing the playlist, then do it. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time.", "chunks": [{"title": "JavaScript Exercise 11 - Calculate the Factorial  Sigma Web Development Course - Tutorial #65 - CodeWithHarry (360p, h264)", "start": 0.0, "end": 2.5, "text": " In Mathematics, factorial means that"}, {"title": "JavaScript Exercise 11 -
